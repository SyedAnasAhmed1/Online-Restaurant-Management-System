# Online-Restaurant-Management-System
Online Restaurant Management System is the process of ordering food from a website .The product can 
be either ready-to-eat food. The aim of developing Online Restaurant Management project is to 
replace the traditional way of taking orders with computerized system. Another important reason for 
developing this project is to prepare order summary reports quickly and in correct format at any point of 
time when required.
Online Restaurant Management has a very lot of scope. This PHP project can be used by any 
restaurants or fast foods for customers for keeping their order records. This project is easy, fast 
and accurate. It requires less disk space. Online Restaurant Management uses MYSQL Server as 
backend so there is not any chance of data loss or data security. A customer can choose to have the 
food delivered or for pick-up. The process consists of a customer choosing the restaurant of their 
choice, scanning the menu items, choosing an item, and finally choosing for pick-up or delivery. 
Payment is then administered by paying with a credit card or debit card through the app or website 
or in cash at the restaurant when going to pickup. The website and app inform the customer of the 
food quality, duration of food preparation, and when the food is ready for pick-up or the amount 
of time it will take for delivery
